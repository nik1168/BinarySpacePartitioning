Program that empirically evaluates the expected size (number of cells) of a random binary space partition using a randomized algortihm. 
This empirical measure will be compared to the upper bound n + 2nHn = O(nlogn)

brew install python
```

## Run

To run the program run either of the following commands:

```shell
python3 main.py test/line_segments_1.txt
python3 main.py test/line_segments_2.txt
python3 main.py test/line_segments_3.txt
